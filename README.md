# Sunrise

**The base layer for Interliquid Networks.**

Sunrise is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain that combines high-throughput data availability with a native liquidity hub. It integrates **Proof of Liquidity (PoL)** and **fee abstraction**, delivering immediate liquidity and flexible gas‑payment options to rollups and application chains. Validators secure the network by staking RISE and/or vRISE. Liquidity providers supply liquidity to pools and earn vRISE and trading fees. Sunrise interoperates with [Rollup and L2 Blockchain](./build/l2-blockchains/README.md), allowing developers to adopt Sunrise with minimal integration effort.

## Key Features

| Feature                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proof of Liquidity (PoL)**    | Validators secure the network by staking RISE and/or vRISE, aligning security _and_ liquidity. Liquidity providers earn vRISE and trading fees.                                       |
| **Fee Abstraction**             | Any token can pay gas; Sunrise swaps a tiny slice to $RISE under the hood. No need to hold multiple tokens for gas.                                                                   |
| **Off‑chain Data Availability** | Large data blobs are propagated and stored off-chain, while only a metadata URI pointing to these erasure-coded data shares are kept on-chain. Optimized for high-throughput rollups. |

## Blazing Fast Data Availability

Sunrise's off‑chain data availability design unlocks unmatched throughput and cost‑efficiency without sacrificing on‑chain security.

1. **Off‑chain Erasure Coding**  
   → Dramatically cuts validator compute & storage: only coded shards live on chain, full data reconstruction happens off‑chain.

2. **Off‑chain Blob Propagation**  
   → Keeps the mempool lightweight and scales to **5 + MB/s**—validators sample availability while nodes fetch or prune blobs on demand.

3. **KZG Commitments**  
   → Cryptographic anchors on‑chain enable sub‑second proof verification and instant challenge resolution.

## Data Availability Features

Sunrise moves heavy data work off‑chain while keeping on‑chain proofs lean and verifiable.

1. **Off-chain Erasure Encoding**  
   Dramatically cuts validator compute & storage: only a metadata URI pointing to these erasure-coded data shares on chain, full data reconstruction happens off‑chain.
2. **Off-chain Storage Integration**  
   Utilizing decentralized storage solutions such as IPFS and Arweave, data shards are stored externally. MsgPublishData includes only a metadata URI pointing to these erasure-coded data shares, reducing the on-chain block size requirements for blob transactions and enhancing scalability.

See [Data Availability](./learn/sunrise/data-availability.md) for more details.

## Why build on Sunrise?

1. **Gasless onboarding** – Users don't need a special gas token; your project's token works.
2. **Instant liquidity** – Provide liquidity and earn vRISE gauge rewards and trading fees.
3. **Rollkit / OP‑Stack ready** – Drop‑in adapters for sovereign or Ethereum‑settled rollups.
