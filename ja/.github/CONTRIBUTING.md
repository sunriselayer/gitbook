Thank you for considering making contributions to the UnUniFi gitbook repository!

**To ensure a smooth workflow for all contributors, the general procedure for contributing has been established:**

Start by browsing new issues and discussions.  
If you are looking for something interesting or if you have something in your mind, there is a chance it had been discussed.  
Looking for a good place to start contributing?

**Determine whether a GitHub issue is more appropriate for your needs:**

If want to propose something new, or you would like to change a process, start with a new issue with close description.
Review existing issues to find an issue you'd like to help with.

**If you would like to contribute:**

Ensure that the proposal has been accepted.  
If nobody has been assigned for the issue and you would like to work on it, make a comment on the issue to inform the community of your intentions to begin work.  
To submit your work as a contribution to the repository follow standard GitHub best practices. See pull request guideline below.

Note: For very small or blatantly obvious problems such as typos, you are not required to an open issue to submit a PR, but be aware that for more complex problems/features, if a PR is opened before an adequate design discussion has taken place in a GitHub issue, that PR runs a high likelihood of being rejected.

### Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request:

- merge the latest main `git merge origin/main`,

Then:

1. If you have something to show, **start with a `Draft` PR**. It's good to have early validation of your work and we highly recommend this practice. A Draft PR also indicates to the community that the work is in progress.
   Draft PRs also helps the core team provide early feedback and ensure the work is in the right direction.
2. When the document is complete, change your PR from `Draft` to `Ready for Review`.
3. Go through the actions for each checkbox present in the PR template description. The PR actions are automatically provided for each new PR.
4. Be sure to include a relevant changelog entry in the `Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md` (see file for log format).

Pull requests are merged once core team member review and approve.
