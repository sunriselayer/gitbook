# CosmWasm

All developers can deploy smart contracts made with **CosmWasm** on UnUniFi. Development requires the knowledge of **CosmWasm**. For more information about CosmWasm, visit [CosmWasm Documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/).

You can replace `wasmd` with `ununifid` in the sentences of the following pages:

* [Setting up Environment](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/setting-env)
* [Deployment and Interaction](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/interact-with-contract)

You can learn more at [CosmWasm Academy](https://academy.cosmwasm.com/) as well.

For more information on CosmWasm CLI commands such as deploy, see [wasm module CLI](../cli-introduction/modules/wasm.md) page.

UnUniFi don't require **Governance Gate** for deploying and instantiating CosmWasm smart contracts. It means that you can deploy and instantiate your CosmWasm smart contracts without proposal and voting.
