# Security

UnUniFi's source codes are currently audited once by Armors Labs.

We will have second security audit after the next round fund raising.

The risk of reentrancy attack is ultimately alleviated in Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm.
See [here](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/architecture/smart-contracts#avoiding-reentrancy-attacks) for the details.
