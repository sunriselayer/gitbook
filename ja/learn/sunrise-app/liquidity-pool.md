# Liquidity Pool

Sunrise's Liquidity Pools (LPs) are a core feature of the decentralized exchange (DEX), allowing users to deposit tokens to provide liquidity and earn rewards such as trading fees and vRISE tokens in return.

## Pool List

On the Liquidity Pool page, you can see a list of all available pools.

Each pool displays the following information:

- **Pair**: The pair of tokens that make up the pool.
- **ID**: The identification number of the pool.
- **TVL**: Total Value Locked in the pool.
- **Fees (24h)**: Trading fees generated in the last 24 hours.
- **Volume (24h)**: Trading volume in the last 24 hours.
- **vRISE Reward Allocation**: The amount of vRISE rewards allocated to this pool.
- **APR (Fees + vRISE)**: The Annual Percentage Rate, combining fees and vRISE rewards.

From the "View Your Positions" button at the top of the page, you can check all the liquidity positions you are providing.

## Pool Details

Selecting a specific pool from the list will take you to its details page.

- **Rewards For Liquidity Providers**: Details on the rewards that liquidity providers can earn in this pool.
  - **Fee Rate**: The trading fee rate for swaps in the pool.
  - **vRISE Reward APR**: The APR from vRISE token rewards. This value fluctuates based on gauge votes.
- **Price Chart**: A chart showing the price fluctuations of the token pair.
- **Statistics**: Statistical information such as TVL, 24h volume, 24h fees, and average APR.
- **Your Liquidity**: A list of your liquidity positions in this pool.

## Managing Liquidity

### Adding Liquidity

You can add liquidity by clicking the "Add Liquidity" button on the pool details page or your positions page.

#### 1. Set Price Range

Select the price range for which you want to provide liquidity.

- **Full Range**: Sets the price range from zero to infinity. This allows you to provide liquidity continuously regardless of price fluctuations, but it is less capital-efficient.
- **Custom**: Set a specific price range. Liquidity will only be provided and earn fees when the price is within your set range. This is more capital-efficient, but you will not earn fees if the price goes out of range.
  - You can use the `logÂ±X%` buttons to quickly set a range based on a percentage from the current price, or manually adjust the range with the slider.

#### 2. Enter Token Amounts

Enter the amount of tokens you want to provide. When you enter the amount for one token, the amount for the other token will be automatically calculated based on the selected price range.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your set price range is entirely above or below the current price, the amount for one of the tokens will be fixed at 0.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing Your Positions

You can view your liquidity positions on the "View Your Positions" page or at the bottom of each pool's detail page.

Selecting a position will show the following details:

- **Position Status**: Indicates whether the current price is `IN RANGE` or `OUT OF RANGE` of your set prices.
- **Price Range**: The price range you have set for providing liquidity.
- **Claimable Rewards**: The unclaimed trading fees generated by your position.
- **Assets in Position**: The amount of assets currently in your position.

### Increasing Liquidity

You can add more liquidity to an existing position by selecting "Increase Liquidity" on the position details page.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: When you increase liquidity, your existing position is liquidated and a new one is created. In this process, any unclaimed rewards are automatically sent to your wallet.
{% endhint %}

### Decreasing Liquidity

You can withdraw some or all of your liquidity from a position by selecting "Decrease Liquidity" on the position details page. You can choose the percentage to withdraw (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) using the slider or buttons.

### Claiming Rewards

You can claim your accumulated trading fees from the "Claim" button on the position details or pool details page. If you have multiple positions, you can also claim all rewards at once.
