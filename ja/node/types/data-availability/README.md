# Data Availability Nodes

## Overview

- [Bridge node](../data-availability/bridge-node.md): This node bridges blocks between the Data-Availability network and the Consensus network.
- [Full storage node](../data-availability/full-node.md): This node stores all the data but does not connect to Consensus.
- [Light node](../data-availability/light-node.md): Light clients conduct data availability sampling on the Data Availability network.

If you are looking to run a consensus node, please follow [the consensus node tutorial](../consensus/README.md).

{% hint style='working' %}
When running a validator node, a bridge node is required. See [this section](../data-availability/bridge-node.md).
