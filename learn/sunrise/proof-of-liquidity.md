# Proof of Liquidity

The `x/proofofliquidity` module is a protocol-level mechanism for managing liquidity proofs within the Sunrise ecosystem. It provides a flexible and efficient way to verify and reward liquidity provision, ensuring sustainable protocol economics while maintaining user accessibility.

## Key Features

- **Protocol-Level Proofs:** Centralized proof management at the protocol level
- **Flexible Proof Types:** Support for different types of liquidity proofs
- **Efficient Verification:** Optimized proof verification mechanisms
- **Economic Sustainability:** Ensures long-term protocol viability

## Core Functionality

> **Note:** The following section covers advanced topics intended for experienced users or developers.

### Proof Management

The module manages different types of proofs:

- **Liquidity Proofs:** For liquidity provision verification
- **Staking Proofs:** For staking verification
- **Custom Proofs:** For protocol-specific verification
- **Cross-Chain Proofs:** For cross-chain liquidity verification

### Proof Verification

Proofs are verified through:

- Proof generation
- Proof validation
- Proof submission
- Proof verification

### Integration with Other Modules

The module integrates with:

- **x/liquidityincentive:** For liquidity reward verification
- **x/gauges:** For gauge voting verification
- **x/governance:** For governance power verification
- **x/fee:** For fee payment verification

## Integration Points

### With Other Modules

- **x/liquidityincentive:** For liquidity reward integration
- **x/gauges:** For gauge voting integration
- **x/governance:** For governance integration
- **x/fee:** For fee payment integration

### With External Systems

- **DEXs:** For liquidity proof integration
- **Staking Platforms:** For staking proof integration
- **Analytics:** For proof performance tracking

## Parameters

The module's behavior is controlled by several parameters:

- `min_proof_amount`: Minimum amount for proofs
- `max_proof_amount`: Maximum amount for proofs
- `proof_types`: Supported proof types
- `verification_threshold`: Threshold for proof verification
- `reward_rate`: Rate for proof rewards

## Example Usage

### Creating a Proof

```go
// Create a new liquidity proof
proof := types.Proof{
    Id:          "proof-1",
    Type:        types.ProofTypeLiquidity,
    Owner:       owner,
    Amount:      amount,
    StartTime:   ctx.BlockTime(),
    EndTime:     ctx.BlockTime().Add(proofDuration),
    IsActive:    true,
}

err := k.CreateProof(ctx, proof)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Verifying a Proof

```go
// Verify an existing proof
verification := types.ProofVerification{
    ProofId:     "proof-1",
    Verifier:    verifier,
    Timestamp:   ctx.BlockTime(),
}

err := k.VerifyProof(ctx, verification)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Rewarding a Proof

```go
// Reward a verified proof
reward := types.ProofReward{
    ProofId:     "proof-1",
    Amount:      rewardAmount,
    Timestamp:   ctx.BlockTime(),
}

err := k.RewardProof(ctx, reward)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```
