# App‑Chain Thesis: Monolithic vs. Modular

The **app‑chain thesis** argues that the optimal way to scale Web3 is to give each major application its **own blockchain** and then connect those chains through an **interoperability layer — in the Cosmos world, IBC**.  
While compelling, the original (“monolithic”) version of this thesis carries hidden operational costs. A new **modular** approach, powered by sovereign rollups and *Rollup‑as‑a‑Service* (RaaS), eliminates most of those frictions.

## Monolithic App‑Chain Thesis

> *“Every serious dApp deserves its own L1.”*

### Advantages

* **Performance isolation** – no gas‑competition with unrelated apps.  
* **Full customisation** – application‑specific VM, fee logic, and governance.  
* **Native interoperability** – IBC packets for cross‑chain calls without trusted bridges.

### Core Weakness – *Validator Bootstrapping*

Launching a bespoke L1 requires:

1. **Recruiting a validator set** (dozens of professional operators).  
2. **Distributing a native token** with sufficient market cap to incentivise honest behaviour.  
3. **Continuous DevOps** – chain upgrades, monitoring, slashing infrastructure, etc.

This overhead slows adoption; many teams stay on shared L1s for simplicity.

## Modular App‑Chain Thesis

> *“Keep sovereignty, outsource consensus.”*

A **sovereign rollup** publishes its block data to a **shared data‑availability (DA) layer** (e.g., Celestia, Avail, EigenDA, Sunrise).  
Security is borrowed from the DA layer’s validator set; the rollup itself only needs a **sequencer** (or shared sequencer network) and application logic.

### Why It Solves Bootstrapping

* **No new validator set** – DA layer provides consensus and economic security.  
* **Token optional** – the app token can focus on in‑app utility; it need not secure consensus.  
* **RaaS platforms** – Rollkit, Dymension, Eclipse, Sovereign SDK, Saga, etc., automate deployment, upgrades, and monitoring.

### Compatibility with IBC

Sovereign rollups can embed **IBC light‑client verification** directly in their state machine, making them *first‑class citizens* in the Cosmos/IBC mesh even though they are not full L1s.

## Smart Contract vs. App Chains – A Hosting Analogy

| Architecture                  | Infra Analogy           | Operational Impact                                           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Smart Contract**            | Shared hosting          | Cheapest to deploy but subject to neighbour congestion and generic fee model. |
| **Modular App‑Specific Chain**| Virtual Private Server  | Near‑dedicated resources; security outsourced; inexpensive rollup bootstrap. |
| **Monolithic App‑Specific Chain** | Dedicated bare‑metal   | Complete control and isolation but highest cost to boot and maintain validators. |

As IaaS evolved from VPS to fully managed platforms, **RaaS will commoditise sovereign rollup deployment** until spinning up a dedicated chain is almost as simple as deploying a smart contract today.

## Roadmap to a Modular Multichain Future

1. **Shared Sequencers & MEV markets** – reduce rollup latency and enable cross‑rollup atomicity.  
2. **Universal IBC clients** – Tendermint, Ethereum‑style SSZ, and ZK‑light clients packaged as reusable modules.  
3. **Permissionless DA pricing** – pay‑per‑byte markets (e.g., Avail’s Proof‑of‑Liquidity) lower fixed costs.  
4. **Inter‑rollup composability** – ICS applications (ICS‑20, ICS‑721, Interchain Accounts) running natively between sovereign rollups.  
5. **Turn‑key governance** – on‑chain upgrade managers and shared security (e.g., Replicated Security, Babylon BTC staking).

The modular app‑chain thesis retains the **sovereignty and customisability** of dedicated chains while achieving **ease‑of‑deployment and economic efficiency** unprecedented in earlier models.
