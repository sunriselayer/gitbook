# Interoperability in Sovereign Rollups

Sovereign rollups mark a significant evolution in Layer 2 design. Instead of delegating cross‑chain validation to a settlement‑layer bridge contract, a sovereign rollup *runs its own light‑client verification* of counterpart chains and therefore decides—at the application level—*how* and *with whom* it communicates.  
This architecture preserves rollup autonomy while still allowing trust‑minimised data availability (DA) and settlement on an external layer.

## Traditional Smart‑Contract Rollups

In a classical optimistic/ZK rollup, every cross‑chain action must pass through **one hard‑coded “enshrined” bridge** that lives on the Layer 1 settlement chain.

**Execution path**

1. **Rollup contract on L1** – stores state roots and bridge logic.  
2. **Proof/optimistic window** – rollup posts proofs or roots; the bridge contract adjudicates fraud/ZK proofs.  
3. **Outbound transfers** – users lock assets inside the bridge; withdrawal proofs are verified by the contract.  
4. **Upgrade friction** – any change to bridge semantics requires an L1 contract upgrade (often via governance hard fork).

**Limitations**

* **Single‑point trust** – the bridge contract becomes systemic risk.  
* **No heterogeneous bridges** – applications cannot add new channels without L1 governance.  
* **Wrapped assets** – most bridges mint IOU tokens instead of native transfers.  
* **Throughput bottleneck** – all messages queue in the same contract; gas spikes propagate to rollup users.

## Sovereign Rollups

A sovereign rollup publishes its data (blobs, state roots) to a DA layer but *self‑verifies* other chains via on‑chain light clients or validity proofs.  
Bridges become regular modules that can be permissionlessly deployed and upgraded.

### Technical Properties

| Capability | Implementation Detail |
|------------|-----------------------|
| **Self‑sovereign verification** | Embedded light client or ZK verifier for each remote chain; no dependency on an external bridge contract. |
| **Multiple protocols** | Support for IBC, custom SNARK bridges, or token‑specific channels in parallel. |
| **Native asset movement** | Light‑client verification lets the rollup unlock *original* tokens, avoiding wrapped IOUs. |
| **Composable channels** | Each application can instantiate independent channels with custom fee logic, rate limits, or middleware. |
| **Decoupled upgrades** | Bridge logic is a rollup module; upgrading does **not** require L1 governance—only rollup governance or code update. |

## IBC — De‑Facto Standard for Sovereign Interoperability

The **Inter‑Blockchain Communication (IBC)** protocol (originating in the Cosmos SDK) provides:

* **Client–Connection–Channel abstraction** – layered handshake that cleanly separates authentication (light clients) from application semantics.  
* **Commit‑only light clients** – each chain stores the other chain’s header commitments and verifies Merkle proofs on‑chain.  
* **Permissionless relayers** – off‑chain processes broadcast packets; any actor can relay without gaining trust power.  
* **ORDERED / UNORDERED channels** – deterministic packet sequencing suited for both fungible tokens (ICS‑20) and arbitrary data (ICS‑27, ICS‑721, etc.).  
* **Timeout & upgrade paths** – channels can close on misbehaviour; light clients autonomously upgrade using on‑chain proof of new client state.

Because sovereign rollups already own their state transition function, integrating IBC requires only:

1. Importing an IBC *core* module (client, connection, channel logic).  
2. Supplying a light‑client implementation for each counterparty (e.g., Tendermint‑BFT, zk‑based header proof, Ethereum‑SSZ).  
3. Defining application modules (token transfers, cross‑rollup DEX, etc.) that marshal packets.

| Bridge Customisation     | Limited or none                         | Fully customizable                          |

| Asset Types              | Often limited to tokens                 | Tokens, NFTs, arbitrary data packets        |
| Security Model           | Inherits L1 bridge contract             | Choice of light‑client or validity proof    |
| Upgrade Path             | Dependent on L1 governance              | Independent—rollup‑level governance         |
